## Introduction

Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in computer vision and machine learning. This project leverages neural networks to create a model capable of accurately classifying handwritten digits.

## Dataset

The model is trained and evaluated on a popular handwritten digit dataset, such as the MNIST dataset, which contains labeled images of handwritten digits.

## Architecture

The neural network architecture is designed for multiclass classification. It may include layers like input layers, hidden layers, and output layers with appropriate activation functions.

```python
# Example neural network architecture code snippet
model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

## Implementation

The implementation includes data preprocessing, model creation, and training code. It may utilize deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Training

The model is trained on the training set and validated on a separate validation set. Training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs are fine-tuned for optimal performance.

## Results

The performance metrics and evaluation results are presented in this section. This includes accuracy, precision, recall, and possibly confusion matrices.

## Conclusion

The project concludes with a summary of the achieved results, potential improvements, and insights gained from the implementation.
